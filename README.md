# Smoke-detection-analysis
A smoke detector is a device that senses smoke, typically as an indicator of fire. Smoke detectors are usually housed in plastic enclosures, typically shaped like a disk about 150 millimetres (6 in) in diameter and 25 millimetres (1 in) thick, but shape and size vary.

Objective: Detect smoke with the help of IoT data and trigger a fire alarm. KNN classifier was used, giving 99% accurate results for k<60.
